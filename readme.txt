Carthage Sans is a reimagining of Apple's Espy Sans 12 bitmap font. It is *not* a copy of Martin Pfeiffer's Nu Sans font, although it is inspired by it. It probably looks better at smaller point sizes, as some of the jaggier bits required to make it look like the bitmap font are a little too obvious when enlarged. 

This release covers the ISO Latin-1 character set plus a couple of minor characters outside of it (particularly the long ƒ, for those of you who still use that convention for your folders). There will be a bold version and possibly a separate "LKE" version (Latina, Kirilitsa, Elleniki) with Cyrillic, Greek, and possibly Hebrew characters. I've not yet decided on doing a Carthage Serif, but it's possible, if I don't get distracted with other projects. 

The name is a complicated pun on "Newton" and is probably not worth trying to explain, but it has to do with the Punic name for Carthage (Qart Hadasht) meaning "new city". (I could perhaps just as easily called it Naples or Novgorod. If this paragraph shows up on r/iamverysmart... I won't be too surprised.)
