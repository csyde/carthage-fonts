README: SFD files
=================

This directory contains the SFD files generated from FontForge (fontforge.github.io if you need to download a copy). They are the result of merging changes from the Fontstruct version of the .ttf files with the files in the repo and contain font metadata that Fontstruct doesn't allow you to edit. If you wish to make changes to the fonts for your own purposes, you should probably start here. 

As mentioned elsewhere, I don't currently plan on adding UFO glyph files; SFD is already an open format, and FontForge can generate UFO files if you need them for AFDKO or something of the sort.
